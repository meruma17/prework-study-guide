# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

This prework study guide is a guide that was developed through an assignment to help new developers to study HTML, CSS, Git and Javascript
I was motivated by the fact that I wish to become a web developer and that this guide helped me improve a lot web development and will be still available for anyone to read and use.
It helped me understand the notions of these coding languages while working on a small project and at the same time gave me an opportunity to come back on it later.
I've learned a lot of things I would not have been able to learn it by myself.
